Services in Azure : 
1. VNET - virtual network - it is logical isolation of netowrk within the microsoft physical network
CIDR - classless inter domain routing

Storage types : blob, files, tables and queues
For managing storages we have to create storage account

blob storage - is used for storing large amount of unstructured data (large files, images, videos etc)
file storage - is used for k8s, so that multiple pods can access a single file system (like volumes)






















SRE - points in resume
building fault-tolerant systems and implementing disaster recovery plans to ensure infrastructure resilience and reliability
Actively contributed to the Staples project for 2 years within a production support team.
Primary responsibility involved ongoing monitoring of critical user tools like Splunk and New Relic.
Conducted continuous analysis using monitoring tools to identify and resolve potential issues.
Played a crucial role in bug management by consistently creating Jira tickets to document and track identified bugs.

Linux Fundamentals: Understand the basics of Linux operating systems, including file systems, command-line usage, and administration.
Networking: Learn about TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, load balancing, and network troubleshooting.
Scripting and Automation: Gain proficiency in scripting languages such as Python, Bash, or Perl to automate tasks and streamline processes.
Cloud Computing Platforms: Familiarize yourself with major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, including services like compute, storage, networking, and databases.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Learn tools like Terraform, Ansible, or Puppet for managing infrastructure declaratively, enabling automation and reproducibility.
Monitoring and Alerting: Understand monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, and know how to set up alerts for key metrics.
Logging and Tracing: Learn about centralized logging systems such as ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd, and distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.
Containerization and Orchestration: Gain expertise in Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration to manage containerized applications efficiently.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Understand CI/CD pipelines and tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI for automating software delivery processes.
Reliability Engineering Principles: Familiarize yourself with SRE principles, including error budgets, service level objectives (SLOs), and service level indicators (SLIs).
Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery: Learn about strategies for building fault-tolerant systems and implementing disaster recovery plans.
Security Best Practices: Understand security principles and best practices for securing systems and applications, including encryption, access control, and vulnerability management.
Performance Optimization: Gain skills in optimizing system performance, including identifying and resolving bottlenecks in applications and infrastructure.
Collaboration and Communication: Develop strong communication and collaboration skills, as SRE often involves working closely with development, operations, and other teams.
Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting: Cultivate strong problem-solving and troubleshooting skills to diagnose and resolve issues quickly and efficiently.
