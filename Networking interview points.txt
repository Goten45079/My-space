Networking for SRE

1. IP address --? it is generated to create a unique address to device --? IPV4(32 bit) | IPV6(128 bit)
IPV4 example 10.3.7.4 each number very from 0-255(8 bits) now total 32 bits for ipv4 standard.
(256*256*256*256) unique id can exist in ipv4

2. VPC --? virtual private cloud (AWS) , VNET --? virtual network (Azure)
3. Subnet --? it is a logical subdivision of ip network or vpc
there are two types of subnets -- private, public
public subnet --?

4. CIDR --? classless inter-domain routing
192, 172, 10 are used for private subnets
192.3.6.0/30 -- will have 4 ip address

5. Ports -- OSI model
computer -- browser -- router -- switch -- 
it has 7 layers - from which data is flowing
a. DNS resolution -- DNS(domain naming serivce) is nothing but a simple DB which has domain names mapped to a ip address, which is maintained by every ISP(internet service provider) 
b. TCP handshake(3-way handshake) transmession control protocall
c. UDP user datagram protocall

layer 7 -- https/ftp -- which is also called as application layer
layer 6 -- encryption/formatting -- presentation layer
layer 5 -- session 
above 3 layer happens at browser level
layer 4 -- transportation layer -- segmentation of data will happen here -- tcp/udp protocall will be initiated
layer 3 -- networking layer -- routing -- data packets will have the routs and address to travel -- ip addresse is attached to packets
layer 2 -- data link layer -- where the data from packets converts to frames and attached with a mac address along with ip address from above layer
layer 1 -- physical layer -- in this layer data is converted to electrical signal and transmitted thorugh optical fibers
